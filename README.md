# Library-Automation-With-C
In this project, a library management system will be developed. There are two different modes in the system.
Student mode;
Login/Logout
the student can list the books stored in the system
the student can borrow books and return the borrowed book.
Librarian Mode;
Login/logout
Listing all books
Searching a book
Update book information
Adding a new book
Deleting a book saved in the system.
After running the program, the user needs to log in to the system. The operations listed above cannot be performed without logging into the system. Login to the system will be done by giving name-surname and password information. The name-surname and password received from the console will be compared with the information in the binary files. When there is a match, the login process will be completed. In the program, 2 separate menus will be displayed to the user. While the processes related to login / logout and termination of the program are displayed in the main menu, the sub-menus will show the menu of actions that can be performed according to the type of user logged in to the system.
Book information will be stored in files named book.bin, student information in student.bin, and librarian information in librarian.bin. The information that needs to be updated according to the operations performed will be updated through these files.
